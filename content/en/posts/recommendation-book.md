I recently read a fascinating book about **C, Assembly and x86-64 architecture**, which opened my eyes to how many things work behind the scenes. The content covers the **basics of processor architecture**, the **operation and usefulness of registers**, and several **concepts used in C programming**.

If you, like me, enjoy "brushing up on bits", this book is a must-read. It serves as an excellent introduction for anyone who wants to dive into low-level programming and understand the deeper layers that support everyday software.
