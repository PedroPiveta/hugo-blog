# Purpose of the post

To serve as a reference guide for PyTorch and Machine Learning.

I plan to update this post as I progress with PyTorch.

# What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is a machine learning library developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). It is widely used for deep learning tasks and provides a flexible, dynamic interface for building and training neural networks.
